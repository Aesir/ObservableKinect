Observable Kinect is an Rx wrapper and facade for the Kinect for Windows SDK which must be installed in order for it to work. 

Initially Observable Kinect is being designed to offer the same functionality as the SDK with IObservable<EventArgs> rather than the standard Kinect SDK events. The end goal is to not only have the same events but also make it easier to get started with the Kinect and perform common tasks.
